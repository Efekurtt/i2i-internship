# üå©Ô∏è Google Cloud VM Creation and Ping Test

## Introduction

Did you know that the first cloud datacenter was launched over a decade ago, yet millions of new virtual machines are still created daily worldwide? A Virtual Machine (VM) is like a computer inside a computer ‚Äî running remotely but accessible from anywhere.  

In this project, we‚Äôll set up a Google Cloud VM and test its connectivity with a simple ping. This small step unlocks the door to endless possibilities in cloud computing and infrastructure management.

## Tools Used  
- Google Cloud Platform  
- Compute Engine  
- Terminal (macOS/Linux/Windows)

## Steps and Screenshots

### 1. Create GCP Account  
Sign up and log in to Google Cloud Platform. ([GCP site](https://cloud.google.com/))
